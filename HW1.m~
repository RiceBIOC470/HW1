% Homework 1. Due before class on 9/6/16.

%% Problem 1 - addition with strings

% Fill in the blank space in this section with code that will add 
% the two numbers regardless of variable type. Hint see the matlab
% functions ischar, isnumeric, and str2num. 

%your code should work no matter which of these lines is uncommented. 
x = 3; y = 5; % integers
%x = '3'; y= '5';

%your code goes here

%output your answer

%% Problem 2 - our first real biology problem

%part 1: write a piece of code that creates a random DNA sequence of length
% N (i.e. consisting of the letter ATGC) where will start with N=500.
% store the output in a variable
% called rand_seq. Hint: the function randi may be useful. Bonus points if
% you can do this without using a loop.

N = 100; % define sequence length

%your code goes here


%part 2: open reading frames (ORFs) are pieces of DNA that can be
% transcribed and translated. they start with a start codon (ATG) and end with a
% stop codon (TAA, TGA, or TAG). Write a piece of code that finds the longest ORF 
% seqeunce rand_seq. This can be in base pairs. 

%part 3: copy your code in parts 1 and 2 but place it inside a loop that
%runs 10000 times. Use this repeating operation to determine the operation
%that a string of
